I am a postdoc at Michigan State University (MSU), and fortunately work with [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/).
Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, 
working with [Prof. Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). 


My research interests focus on developing efficient, trustworthy, and application-driven machine learning algorithms, particularly in Graph Learning, Information Retrieval, and AI for Science.
