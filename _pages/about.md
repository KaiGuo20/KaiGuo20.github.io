I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at Rice University, 
working with [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). Before that, I received Bachelor degree from 
Sun Yat-sen University in 2015, and received Master degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018, 
under supervision of [Prof. Chen Gong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/) and [Prof. Zhengyuan Xu](http://owc.ustc.edu.cn/2014/0818/c10523a116333/page.htm).


My research interests lie in the broad area of graph data mining, 
particularly in graph nueral networks, 
large-scale graph computation, graph meta learning, and the real-world applications.
