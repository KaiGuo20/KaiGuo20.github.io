I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science at Rice University, 
working with [Prof. Xia (Ben) Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). Before that, I received Bachelor degree from 
Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in 2015, and received Master degree from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2018, 
under supervision of [Prof. Chen Gong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/) and [Prof. Zhengyuan Xu](http://owc.ustc.edu.cn/2014/0818/c10523a116333/page.htm).


My research interests lie in the broad area of large-scale graph data mining and machine learning, 
particularly in deep graph analysis, 
efficient graph representation learning, and the science applications in biochemical informatics and graph quantum computing.

Email: Kaixiong.Zhou at rice.edu. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/Kaixiong-Zhou/kaixiong-zhou.github.io/blob/master/files/Kaixiong_CV.pdf)

<p style="color:red;"> I will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. 
Before that, I will be a Postdoctoral Researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working on drug discovery and synthetic biology with [Prof. James J. Collins](https://be.mit.edu/directory/james-j-collins).
I am looking for self-motivated students. Please feel free to send me an email together with resume and transcripts if you are interested.
