I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, 
working with [Prof. Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). I am currently visiting Michigan State University (MSU) under supervision of [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/). 


My research interests lie in the broad area of large-scale graph data mining and machine learning, 
particularly in deep graph analysis and out-of-distribution shift.
